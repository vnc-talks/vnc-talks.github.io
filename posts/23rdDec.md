# 23rd December

so basically i hurt my girlfriend so bad some days ago, like she has some expectations from me. i try to fullfill it always, but i failed last day. she wanted me to take care of her but first she hurt my feelings by triggering my past trauma and then she started telling her problems. i tried my best to control but i couldn't and lashed out on her. it is my fault.

 I have convinced myself that I cannot change for the good, because end of the day I am that selfish brute that will keep on making the same mistake over and over again. I put myself ahead of everyone again and again. 

  I try to survive everyday hating myself. I am sorry for being a burden in everyone's life and ruining every moment of it. I cause ruin. I enable every bad thing in people's life. And maybe she were right, so was everyone else, I am not worth loving, I only bring burden and sadness in people's life. You know what is common between everyone? I was involved. Maybe no one ever was wrong. It was genuinely just me who was selfish and tried to get my agenda of being happy ahead so much that I forgot to love and care for other people. Maybe I was, am and always will be the cancerous tumor in everyone's life.

she hates me, and i deserve to be unloved forever. fuck my life.
